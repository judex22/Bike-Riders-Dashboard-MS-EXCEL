# Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard Using MS Excel

The Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard gives insights on how factors such as Marital Status, Region and Educational background affect the number of purchases by customers and income generated by the sales of bikes.

The dataset is first cleaned using MS Excel by dropping duplicates, replacing specific data with categorical data etc., followed by implementing Pivot Tables that is used on the Dashboard.

One of the many interesting insights gained using the dashboard is that the married women from the Pacific holding a high school or Graduate degree, had overall more contribution towards bikes sales on average than married men from Pacific, whereas married women from the Pacific holding Partial education levels had significantly contribution towards bikes sales on average. Also married Pacific women holding high school degree belonged between adolescent and middle age group whereas the men were either middle age and senior citizens.

The above insight could be used to specifically Target Married Women from the Pacific holding either High School or Graduate degree, by either advertising to them or using other business strategies to further increase Sales of Bikes in the Future.
